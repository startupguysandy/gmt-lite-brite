# Lite Brite

In this project, we’ll build a JavaScript version of a Lite Brite, the 1980’s-era light box toy. It should generate a table of “pegs” (buttons) that we can click to “light them up” (change their color) and create art projects.

#### For this project, we need to…
1. Create the game board and inject it into the DOM.
2. Provide users with a way to select the color “pegs” they want to use.
3. Listen for when they interact with the game board in some way and place a “peg” on it.

#### Some things to consider…

* How would someone play this game if they could only navigate with a keyboard?
* How are you going to make different colors appear?
* Can someone reset the board when they’re done or want to start over?
* How will you setup the board/layout?
